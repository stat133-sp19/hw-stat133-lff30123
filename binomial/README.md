The purpose of this assignment is to create an R package that implements functions for
calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the
probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

The Binomial distribution is perhaps the most famous probability distribution among discrete
random variables. This is the theoretical probability model that we use when calculating
probabilities about the number of successes in a fixed number of random trials performed
under identical conditions (assuming a constant probability of success on each trial).


There are three types of functions in the package:
• private: these are auxiliary functions not intended to be called by the user (in red
color).
• main: these are the main functions that the user is expected to invoke (in blue color).
• methods: these are also public functions (in yellow color) that support classes of
objects generated by some of the main functions.
